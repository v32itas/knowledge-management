# knowledge-management

=== Concept ===
This is not yet for datamining. It's just improving the ability to get right knowledge while wasting no time for for browsing web. Datamining is hardcore. This is just 50/50 manual/auto work.

== Data Extraction ==
1. Multiple Data Extraction tools for specific API's or sources, ruthless and simple.
2. IRC Bot for command line interface to all data extraction tools as well as for logging an archiving.

== Data Analysis ==
1. Planning for automated data analysis will be necessary only after building a good basis of data extraction. So data extraction is top-priority. And it will help us to learn the patterns of data that we seek to convert into knowledge.
 

=== In progress ===
1. Simple Perl IRC API bot(building).
2. yellowAPI data extractor module(improvement) - (yellowapi-scrap.pl)
3. Facebook API data exchange module(building)

=== To-do ===
1. Pinterest API data extractor module
2. google+ API data extractor module
3. skype API data exchange module
4. ....

It's just as a domain for this pile of scripts.

##0. [Perl](http://www.perlmonks.org/)
Perl is just because every single system admin that I respect (like **Urchlay** from **\#\#slackware**), recommended me to learn Perl. Now when I started I cannot explain it yet, but I already feel why.
##1. Concept of The System
This is not yet for datamining. It's just improving the ability to get right knowledge while wasting no time for for browsing web. Datamining is hardcore. This is just 50/50 manual/auto work.
### [Data Extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_extraction)
1. Multiple Data Extraction tools for specific API's or sources, ruthless and simple.
2. IRC Bot for CLI to all data extraction tools as well as for logging, archiving and most importantly [command and control C5I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control).

### [Data Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis)
1. Planning for automated data analysis will be necessary only after building a good basis of data extraction. So data extraction is top-priority. And it will help us to learn the patterns of data that we seek to convert into knowledge.
 

##2. In progress
1. **Perl** Simple [IRC Bot](http://search.cpan.org/~hinrik/Bot-BasicBot-0.89/lib/Bot/BasicBot.pm) for [command and control C5I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control).
2. **Perl** [yellowAPI](http://www.yellowapi.com/docs/places/) - data extractor. [module](https://github.com/v32itas/systems-thinking/blob/scraps/yellowapi-scrap.pl)
3. **Perl** [Facebook API](https://developers.facebook.com/) data exchange module.

##3. To-do
1. [Pinterest API](https://developers.pinterest.com/) data extractor module
2. [google+ API](https://developers.google.com/+/web/api/rest/) data extractor module
3. [skype API](http://www.skype.com/en/developer/) data exchange module
4. ....
